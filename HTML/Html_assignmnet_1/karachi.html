        The region has been inhabited for millennia,[27] but the city was formally founded as the fortified village of Kolachi as recently as 1729.[28][29] The settlement greatly increased in importance on arrival of the East India Company in the mid-19th century. British administrators embarked on substantial projects to transform the city into a major seaport, and connect it with the extensive railway network of the Indian subcontinent.[29] At the time of Pakistan’s independence in 1947, the city was the largest in Sindh with an estimated population of 400,000 people.[23] Afterwards, city experienced a dramatic shift in population and demography with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Muhajir (Urdu-speaking people)    </p>
