            <h1>The End Of The Summer</h1>
            <p>The birds laugh loud and long together
                When Fashion's followers speed away
                At the first cool breath of autumn weather.
                Why, this is the time, cry the birds, to stay!
                When the deep calm sea and the deep sky over
                Both look their passion through sun-kissed space,
                As a blue-eyed maid and her blue-eyed lover
                Might each gaze into the other's face.
            </p>
