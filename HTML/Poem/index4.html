            <h1>The End Of The Summer</h1>
            <p>Some chill grey dawn you note with grieving
                That the King of Autumn is on his way.
                You see, with a sorrowful, slow believing,
                How the wanton woods have gone astray,
                They wear the stain of bold caresses,
                Of riotous revels with old King Frost;
                They dazzle all eyes with their gorgeous dresses,
                Nor care that their green young leaves are lost.
