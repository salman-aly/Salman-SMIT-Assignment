            <h1>The End Of The Summer</h1>
            <p>A wet wind blows from the East one morning,
                The wood's gay garments looked draggled out.
                You hear a sound, and your heart takes warningâ€•
                The birds are planning their winter route.
                They wheel and settle and scold and wrangle,
                Their tempers are ruffled, their voices loud;
                Then whirr and away in a feathered tangle,
                To fade in the south like a passing cloud.
            </p>
